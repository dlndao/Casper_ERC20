            <p>The Decentralized Lending Network today announced the signing of a Letter (LOI) of Intent with Questscope (<a href='https://www.questscope.org/en' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">Questscope.org.</a>). </p>
            <p>Brandishing the credo &ldquo;Putting the last, first,&rdquo; Questscope, with headquarters in the U.S., UK and Jordan, is a philanthropic organization aimed at bringing social change to those in need throughout the Middle East.</p>
            <p>The LOI, substantively, indicates that Questscope is interested in collaborating on a proof of concept, specifically, through integration of the new rails offered by the Decentralized Lending Network (<a href='https://dln.org/' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">DLN.org</a>).</p>
            <p>The Decentralized Lending Network is a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, which leverages the efficiencies of decentralized finance (DeFi) on the blockchain and patent-pending tech, to help philanthropic organizations scale to better help the communities they serve.</p>
            <p>Dr. Adel Elmessiry, CTO and President of AlphaFin, Inc., the company that created the code upon which DLN was built, is proud to count Questscope as a partner. &ldquo;Receiving a letter of intent from an organization like Questscope, with a history spanning more than 30 years, and a pedigree of helping so many improve their stations in life, itâ€™s a real achievement for DLN, and illustrates the kind of change DLN is here to make.&rdquo;</p>
