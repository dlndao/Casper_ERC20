            <p>&ndash; AlphaFin, Inc, the company developing DLN.org, the Decentralized Lending Network, today announced that they have inked a Letter of Intent with charity organization Afghanistan Women Council (AWC).</p>
            <p>Winner of a United Nations Award for Peace, among others, AWC was founded in 1986, providing a constantly-evolving cadre of development activities to women and families in war-torn Afghanistan.</p>
            <p>The team at AlphaFin, Inc. is eager to leverage the power of the Decentralized Lending Network (DLN.org) to develop a proof of concept for and with AWC.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The goal with DLN,&rdquo; AlphaFin&rsquo;s CEO Todd Glider explains, &ldquo;is to provide groups like AWC with the ability to offer more micro-loans to the communities they serve. This is achieved via the power of the blockchain, and the patent-pending innovation, Social Staking, which my partner, Dr. Adel Elmessiry, invented.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I have always been energized by Impact Investing,&rdquo; says Elmessiry, the President and CTO of AlphaFin, Inc. &ldquo;Social impact. Environmental impact. That&rsquo;s a principle reason that I envisioned the Decentralized Lending Network as a DAO from the very beginning.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Network, is blockchain-speak for Open Source. As such, while the idea and development of DLN in its early stages was orchestrated AlphaFin, Inc., AlphaFin, Inc. no more owns DLN than a writer of a Wikipedia article owns Wikipedia.</p>
            <p>The partnership, Glider notes, between AlphaFin and Afghanistan Women Council, seemed like kismet from the beginning.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Disbelief. That&rsquo;s one of the challenges we face when presenting DLN to Microfinance Institutions,&rdquo; said Glider. &ldquo;The efficiencies inherent in the blockchain, the earnings one is afforded through participation in the decentralized finance space, through even the most conservative investment, it can sound too good to be true, especially if one is new to the space. AWC, we saw, upon first visiting their website, is well ahead of the curve. They&rsquo;ve been, accepting cryptocurrency donations for a while now.&rdquo;</p>
