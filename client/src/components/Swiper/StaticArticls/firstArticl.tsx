            <p>The Decentralized Lending Network (DLN.org) has a new partner, AlphaFin, Inc. announced today. AlphaFin, the company developing DLN, has signed a Letter of Intent with NGO Hands Empowering the Less Privileged in Sierra Leone (HELP-Salone).</p>
            <p>HELP-Salone delivers a cadre of services to the less fortunate in the West African nation, including Microfinance loans, clean water initiatives, female empowerment services and more.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;One of the great things about this job, and really, perhaps, the greatest thing about it,&rdquo; offers AlphaFin, Inc CEO Todd Glider, &ldquo;is that our technology is helping rainmakers bring more rain to the communities they serve.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Glider&rsquo;s partner, the CTO and President of AlphaFin, Inc., Dr. Adel Elmessiry, is pleased that the message about the technology he invented is getting out. &ldquo;DLN is here to change lives, to make an impact. It is a new set of rails for the world of Microfinance. I am proud of the fact that we have signed a letter of intent with HELP-Salone.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The Decentralized Lending Network is a decentralized project that leverages the inherent social capital in unbanked communities around the world, incentivizing more Microfinance borrowers to borrow, and more Microfinance lenders to lend.</p>
            <p>DLN leverages the power of the blockchain, and a patent-pending innovation called Social Staking, to make this happen.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;DLN is a three-party system,&rdquo; explained Glider. &ldquo;Borrowers&rsquo; friends, family and neighbors lend a hand by helping to collateralize the borrowers&rsquo; loans. That collateral is then locked by a smart contract, and invested on the blockchain. Once collateralized, a lender dispenses the loan to the borrower. As the borrower repays the loan, that collateral is generating interest.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;That interest is significant, and it is split into thirds,&rdquo; said Elmessiry. &ldquo;DLN takes a portion of it to cover system fees, which makes the loans interest-free. A third is given to the borrowers&rsquo; friends and families. And the other third is given to the lenders.&rdquo;</p>
