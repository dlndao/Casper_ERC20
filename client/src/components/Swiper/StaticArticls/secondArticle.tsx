            <p>&ndash; FinTech company AlphaFin, Inc., today announced receipt of a Letter of Intent from Dhosa Chandaneswar Bratyajan Samity (DCBS.in) a Development Organization with headquarters in Kolkata, India.</p>
            <p>DCBS has expressed interest in collaborating on a proof of concept with AlphaFin, Inc. The collaboration will focus on the FinTech company&rsquo;s current project, a decentralized autonomous organization named the Decentralized Lending Network (DLN.org).</p>
            <p>The Decentralized Lending Network is a financial technology project that lives on the blockchain. The open source solution leverages decentralized finance and a patent- pending innovation called Social Staking to help Microfinance Institutions around the world scale to better help the communities they serve.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re honored to be working with DCBS,&rdquo; AlphaFin CEO Todd Glider. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re an organization that&rsquo;s been changing lives in the Indian states of West Bengal &amp; Bihar for nearly 20 years. DLN and AlphaFin are going to help them change even more.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Glider, and his partner, Dr. Adel Elmessiry, the CTO/President of AlphaFin, Inc. and the visionary behind the Decentralized Lending Network, are keen to get started.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;We have been serving communities in West Bengal &amp; Bihar for 18 years to improve the quality of life of poor rural women,&rdquo; said DCBS CEO Animesh Naiya. &ldquo;DCBS has visionised to reach another three more neighbouring States by 2025. We look forward to seeing how DLN can help us provide our clients with more aid.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;DCBS has a credo that really struck us when we were looking for MFIs to approach about working with DLN,&rdquo; said Elmessiry. &ldquo;&lsquo;Dreams are Universal. Opportunity is Not.&rsquo; That really says it all. Our intentions are aligned. Between DLN, AlphaFin, and DCBS, there is opportunity for all!&rdquo;</p>
